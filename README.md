# Computational Geometry Challenge Solution

This challenge is to implement a heavily simplified form of some 2D
boundary-representation geometry data structures and algorithms, as described [here](GeometryTakeHome.md).


### Obstacles. 

I am not familiar with graphic libraries, so I built a rudimentary SVG-based one. I had to teach myself SVG. And run a refresher on high school trigonometry.

### TODO

1. The code needs major refactoring. Everything lives at the presentation layer.

2. I assume input needs to be heavily sanity-checked, given the nature of real life challenges faced by the company.

3. Assumptions regarding the input need to be verified.

 *  I am almost positive I got the concept of "fillets" right, but need to double-check.

 * All arcs are 90 degrees and start and end at 90 * n degrees angles.



### Latest SVG renderer snapshot

This is the latest snapshot of the  renderer [svg/render.html](svg/render.html).

Currently, working on item #4 of the challenge. Red chords approximate the arcs. At this point, with arbitrary deflection.
