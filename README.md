# Computational Geometry Challenge Solution

This challenge is to implement a heavily simplified form of some 2D
boundary-representation geometry data structures and algorithms, as described [here](GeometryTakeHome.md).


### Obstacles. 

I am not familiar with graphic libraries, so I had to build a rudimentary SVG-based one. Learning SVG took most of the assignment time. (That, and a refresher on trigonometry.) 

### TODO 

The code needs major refactoring. Everything lives at the presentation layer.

### Assumptions

1. All arcs are 90 degrees and start and end at 90 * n degrees angles.
